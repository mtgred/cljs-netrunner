  eid: the eid of the entire triggering sequence, which will be completed when all handlers are completed
  event: the event keyword to trigger handlers for
  first-ability: an ability map (fed to resolve-ability) that should be resolved after the list of handlers is determined
                 but before any of them is actually fired. Typically used for core rules that happen in the same window
                 as triggering handlers, such as trashing a corp Current when an agenda is stolen. Necessary for
                 interaction with New Angeles Sol and Employee Strike
  card-ability:  a card's ability that triggers at the same time as the event trigger, but is coded as a card ability
                 and not an event handler. (For example, :stolen on agendas happens in the same window as :agenda-stolen
  after-active-player: an ability to resolve after the active player's triggers resolve, before the opponent's get to act
  cancel-fn:     a function that takes one argument (the state) and returns true if we should stop the event resolution
                 process, likely because an event handler caused a change to the game state that cancels future handlers.
