# Developing with Docker

A quick way to get netrunner up and running locally is using the
`docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` in this repo. You'll
need [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker)
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Once you've got those,
just run

    ./compose.sh -b
    
This should start spinning up your own instance of netrunner! Easy.

Note that the first run will probably need to download a bunch of docker images,
which may take quite a while. Subsequent runs should be quite a lot quicker.

The `-b` flag builds the netrunner-node docker image and should only be needed
on the first run.

When you're done, run `docker-compose stop` to stop the running containers or
`docker-compose down` to stop and destroy containers.

## Issues

While it does the job, this set-up isn't perfect. A lot of the issues are to do
with the order that services start in mattering. Here are some specific issues:

  - If the fetch-cards job runs before mongo is fully started up, cards won't be
    correctly imported into the database. Hence the kludgey `sleep 30` in
    `compose.sh`.
  - The lein* services download there dependencies every time they're run.
  - You need to change the db part (line 6) of the dev.edn from localhost to mongodb
    for the containers to see the database, if you choose to use this docker setup.
